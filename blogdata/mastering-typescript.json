  "content": "<p>TypeScript is JavaScript with static type checking. It helps you write more reliable code and catch errors before they reach production. Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Airbnb use TypeScript extensively.</p><h2>Why TypeScript Matters</h2><p>TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, making your code more maintainable and easier to refactor. It provides excellent IDE support with autocomplete and inline documentation.</p><h2>1. Start with Basic Types</h2><p>Learn about primitive types (string, number, boolean), arrays, objects, and tuples. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial before moving to advanced features.</p><h2>2. Master Interfaces and Types</h2><p>Interfaces and type aliases are powerful tools for defining object shapes. Learn the differences between them and when to use each one.</p><h2>3. Understand Generics</h2><p>Generics allow you to write reusable code that works with multiple types. They're essential for building libraries and complex applications.</p><h2>4. Learn Type Utilities</h2><p>TypeScript provides many utility types like Partial, Pick, Omit, and Record. These help you manipulate types without writing complex type definitions.</p><h2>5. Practice with Real Projects</h2><p>Convert JavaScript projects to TypeScript, or start new projects with TypeScript from the beginning. The more you use it, the more comfortable you'll become.</p><h2>6. Explore Advanced Features</h2><p>Learn about conditional types, mapped types, template literal types, and type inference. These advanced features will make you a TypeScript expert.</p>",
