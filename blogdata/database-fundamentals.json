  "content": "<p>Understanding databases is essential for building data-driven applications. Learn the fundamentals of SQL and NoSQL databases and when to use each.</p><h2>Types of Databases</h2><p>Databases are broadly categorized into SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases. Each type has its strengths and use cases.</p><h2>1. Learn SQL Fundamentals</h2><p>Master basic SQL operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. Learn about WHERE clauses, JOINs, aggregations, and subqueries. SQL is the foundation of relational databases.</p><h2>2. Understand Database Design</h2><p>Learn about normalization, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Good database design is crucial for scalability.</p><h2>3. Explore NoSQL Databases</h2><p>Understand document databases (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), and graph databases. Learn when NoSQL is a better choice than SQL.</p><h2>4. Master MongoDB</h2><p>MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database. Learn about collections, documents, queries, indexing, and aggregation pipelines. It's perfect for flexible schemas.</p><h2>5. Understand ORMs and ODMs</h2><p>Learn tools like Prisma, Sequelize, or Mongoose that simplify database interactions. These tools provide type safety and easier query building.</p><h2>6. Optimize Database Performance</h2><p>Learn about indexing, query optimization, connection pooling, and caching strategies. Performance optimization is crucial for production applications.</p><h2>7. Ensure Data Integrity</h2><p>Implement transactions, constraints, and validation. Learn about ACID properties and how to maintain data consistency in your applications.</p><h2>8. Practice Database Security</h2><p>Understand SQL injection, parameterized queries, and access control. Security is paramount when handling sensitive data.</p>",
