Learn the principles and best practices that make APIs great.</p><h2>What is REST?</h2><p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods and status codes to create predictable, scalable APIs.</p><h2>1. Understand HTTP Methods</h2><p>Learn when to use GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Each method has a specific purpose and semantics that should be respected.</p><h2>2. Design Clear URLs</h2><p>Use nouns, not verbs in your endpoints. Follow RESTful conventions like /users, /users/:id, /users/:id/posts. Keep URLs simple and intuitive.</p><h2>3. Use Proper Status Codes</h2><p>Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500, etc.). Status codes communicate the result of requests clearly to clients.</p><h2>4. Implement Pagination</h2><p>For endpoints that return lists, implement pagination to handle large datasets efficiently. Use query parameters like ?page=1&limit=10.</p><h2>5. Handle Errors Gracefully</h2><p>Return consistent error responses with clear messages. Include error codes and helpful descriptions that help developers debug issues.</p><h2>6. Implement Authentication</h2><p>Learn about API authentication methods like API keys, JWT tokens, and OAuth. Secure your APIs to protect sensitive data.</p><h2>7. Version Your APIs</h2><p>Use versioning (like /api/v1/users) to allow changes without breaking existing clients. This is crucial for maintaining backward compatibility.</p><h2>8. Document Your APIs</h2><p>Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to document your APIs. Good documentation is essential for API adoption and developer experience.</p>",
