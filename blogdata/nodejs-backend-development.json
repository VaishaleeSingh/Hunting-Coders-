  "content": "<p>Node.js allows you to build scalable server-side applications using JavaScript. It's used by companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal for their backend infrastructure.</p><h2>Getting Started with Node.js</h2><p>Node.js runs JavaScript on the server using the V8 engine. It's event-driven and non-blocking, making it perfect for building fast, scalable applications.</p><h2>1. Set Up Your Environment</h2><p>Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Learn about package.json, npm scripts, and how to manage dependencies. Understanding the Node.js ecosystem is crucial.</p><h2>2. Learn Core Modules</h2><p>Study Node.js built-in modules like fs (file system), path, http, and events. These modules are the foundation of Node.js development.</p><h2>3. Master Express.js</h2><p>Express is the most popular web framework for Node.js. Learn routing, middleware, error handling, and how to structure Express applications.</p><h2>4. Understand Asynchronous Programming</h2><p>Master callbacks, promises, and async/await. Node.js is built around asynchronous operations, so this is essential for writing efficient code.</p><h2>5. Work with Databases</h2><p>Learn to integrate databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. Understand ORMs like Mongoose or Prisma, and learn about database design patterns.</p><h2>6. Build RESTful APIs</h2><p>Create APIs that follow REST principles. Learn about HTTP methods, status codes, authentication (JWT), and API documentation with tools like Swagger.</p><h2>7. Deploy Your Applications</h2><p>Learn to deploy Node.js applications on platforms like AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean, or Railway. Understand environment variables, process managers like PM2, and production best practices.</p>",
