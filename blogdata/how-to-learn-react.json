It's used by companies like Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, and thousands more.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Before diving into React, make sure you have a solid understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You should be comfortable with ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and modules.</p><h2>1. Understand the Core Concepts</h2><p>Start with components, JSX, props, and state. These are the building blocks of every React application. Don't move forward until you're comfortable with these concepts.</p><h2>2.
